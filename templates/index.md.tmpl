# Dash0 Provider

The Dash0 provider provides dashboard, check rule and more resources for [Dash0](https://dash0.com/).

The changelog for this provider can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/dash0hq/terraform-provider-dash0/releases).

## Authentication

The Dash0 provider supports two authentication methods. You can get the authentication credentials through [Dash0's settings screens](https://app.dash0.com/settings/auth-tokens).

### Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)

Environment variables take precedence over provider configuration attributes.

```sh
export DASH0_URL="https://api.us-west-2.aws.dash0.com"
export DASH0_AUTH_TOKEN="auth_xxxx"
```

### Option 2: Provider Configuration

Alternatively, you can configure authentication directly in the provider block:

```terraform
provider "dash0" {
  url        = "https://api.us-west-2.aws.dash0.com"
  auth_token = "auth_xxxx"
}
```

**Note:** Environment variables (`DASH0_URL` and `DASH0_AUTH_TOKEN`) will override provider configuration attributes if both are set.
